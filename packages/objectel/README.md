objectel is library which provides highly-abstracted object in order to resolve hierarchical problem via composition

objectel uses few un-popular mindset which is called [callbag](https://github.com/callbag/callbag)
I just told you "callbag is unpopular mindset". but don't think callbag badly, it is awesome standard.
if you overcome some complexity of callbag, then you may find yourself in 'callbag heaven'.

here is some good articles about callbag, if you doesn't friendly with callbag, you will do better to read these articles.

this article does not related to callbag, but I believe this is one of best article in reactive programming's history
